		<h2>
		Where Is It Located? <p class= "map"> <img src= "map.jpg" alt= "Map of Canada to locate the Pacific 
		Maritime Ecozone" width= 300 height= 200</p>
		</h2>
		
		<p>
		The pacific maritime is a terrestrial ecozone located along the coast of British columbia, borders Alaska,
		and covers a small portion of the Yukon territory. Major cities include Vancouver, Victoria, and Prince Rupert. 
		</p>

		<h2>
		Climate 
		</h2>
		
		<p>
		The climate in the Pacific maritime is very moderate due to being near the Pacific Ocean. Because it 
		has a maritime climate, winters tend to be more mild and summers are much cooler. The average summer temperature is 
		about 12-13 degrees celsius and winters are about -1 degrees. The range between monthly temperatures are very little 
		compared to the rest of Canada. Being near water also causes the Pacific maritime to have one of the wettest weather. 
		The highest precipitation received is about 5,000 mm per year and the lowest was about 500 mm.  
		</p>
		
		<h2>
		Landforms
		</h2>
		
		<p>
		The Pacific Maritime covers about 196,200 kilometers square of land. The Coast mountains take up majority of this ecozone. 
		Due to being very young, they are very steep and rugged therefore, erosion has not happened yet. At the very highest
		elevations, glaciers and ice sheets are found. The mountains are mostly made up of granite. Fiords are also other 
		landforms to look out for and there are many in the Pacific Maritime. A fiord is an inlet of sea between mountains. 
		They can be up to 190 kilometers wide and 2000 km deep. Another major landform is the forests which covers about 50 
		percent of the ecozone. There are 5 major forest in the ecozone: <p class= "forest"><img src= "forest.jpg" alt= "forest" 
		width= 550px height= 150px></p> <li> Western Hemlock Forests</li>
		<li>Mountain Hemlock Forests</li><li>Douglas fir Forests</li><li>Arbutus and Garry Oak woodland forest</li><li>The Great Bear 
		Rainforest</li><p>Since the Pacific Maritime ecozone is part of the Ring of Fire, many hot springs are scattered throughout. 
		These tend to smell because of the sulfur content. In these areas, magma is very close to the surface and so it causes the water
		to be very hot.</p>
